2. Open a chromium based web browser of choice.
3. Go to chrome://extensions/
4. Enable Developer Mode
5. Click "Load Unpacked"
6. Navagate to the folder and install it
7. Click the extensions button and pin the extension.
8. Click the extension and insert an Astroid V3 link.
9. Click Inject and Enjoy!

ps. click uninject when you stop wanting to play astroid
